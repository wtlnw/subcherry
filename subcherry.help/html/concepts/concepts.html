<h1>Feature Level Development</h1>
<p>
Depending on the chosen branching model, it is quite common to develop features in a separate branch
and then re-integrate them back into the main development branch (or trunk). However,
using the SVN's re-integrate feature results in a single (potentially large) commit on trunk. When 
viewing the commit history of trunk, only the single bulk re-integrate commit will be seen at first 
glance. In order to actually see what happened, one has to dig deeper which is very time consuming.
</p>
<p>
That's where Subcherry comes into play. It replays the commit history of one branch on another 
and allows users to select which changes to replay. This way the commit history on feature level
is preserved which allows very simple blame and diff overviews all the way down to a single line 
of code, making it very easy to understand when and why changes occurred.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, when using <a href="https://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> to track the development progress
it is even easier to find out which feature (ticket) has already been re-integrated and when.
