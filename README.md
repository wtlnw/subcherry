# SubCherry - Cherry Picking with Trac and Subversion

SubCherry enables you to manage multiple development branches of a software development project on the feature level. It enriches the Subversion infrastructure with selective merge functionality that keeps precise annotate/blame information on each line of your code on every branch. In combination with the Trac issue tracking system this empowers you to arbitrarily combine software features to new software configurations and easily maintain them.
