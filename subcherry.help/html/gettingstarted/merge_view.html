<h1>Subcherry Merge View</h1>
<p>
After successfully completing the <a href="merge_wizard.html">Subcherry Merge Wizard</a>
the Subcherry Merge View is opened and ready to start the replay process. In this guide,
users will learn how to use the view to replay the selected commit history.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view.png"/>

The above screen shows a table overview of revisions which will be replayed in the course
of the replay process. The displayed revisions are sorted in the order of their execution
(which typically matches the ascending order by revision number). For each revision, an icon
indicates the revision's replay state and provides a tooltip for states awaiting user
action. The <i>Message</i> column displays a preview of the rewritten message which will
be used when committing the revision upon replay.
</p>
<p>
The replay process can be manipulated using the buttons in the view's toolbar. The buttons
availability depends on Subcherry Merge View to be the currently active view to prevent 
unwanted actions.
</p>

<h2 id="revision_details">Revision Details</h2>
<p>
Every revision entry in the Subcherry Merge View can be double-clicked to show the revision
details. The dialog displays the same information as the Subcherry Merge Wizard's
<a href="merge_wizard.html#revision_details">Revision Details</a> section.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_details.png"/>

In addition to the revision information and changes resources the above dialog also displays 
the revision's current replay state (and error messages if applicable).
</p>

<h2>Run/Resume</h2>
<p>
To start replaying commit history the <img src="../images/merge_view_run.png"/>
button in the view's toolbar can be pressed. This button is only active if the
Subcherry Merge View is active and at least one pending revision is available.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_progress.png"/>

The replay process will then be started and a progress dialog appears, reporting
the replay progress to the user. The replay process can be cancelled using the
dialog's <b>Cancel</b> button.
</p>

<p class="Note">
NOTE: Cancellation will take effect upon the replay process entering specific
cancellation points which might take several seconds (e.g. when the task is
waiting for the SVN server to response etc.).
</p>

<p>
Revision entries are processed in four steps:
<ol>
<li><b>Apply</b> changes specified by the current revision to the current workspace.</li>
<li><b>Refresh</b> the workspace to reflect changes.</li>
<li><b>Commit</b> changes to the SVN repository.</li>
<li><b>Update</b> changes resources to HEAD revision.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note">
NOTE: If the <b>No Commit</b> setting was enabled in the Subcherry Merge Wizard's
<a href="merge_wizard.html#no_commit">Additional settings</a> section, the last two
steps are skipped.
</p>

Once a revision entry is processed successfully, the next one is replayed and so on.
Successfully processed revision entries cannot be re-processed again.
The replay process will continue running until
<ul>
<li>all revisions have been processed successfully or</li>
<li>an error occurred or</li>
<li>a conflict is detected while processing the current revision.</li>
</ul>

When conflicts or errors are detected the replay process is automatically paused and 
the Subcherry Merge View is updated to reflect the progress up to now.
</p>

<h2>Skip</h2>
<p>
The currently pending revision can be skipped by pressing the
<img src="../images/merge_view_skip.png"/> button. A dialog appears, explaining the
consequences of revision skipping and prompting users to confirm their choice by
pressing the <b>Skip</b> button.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_skip_confirm.png"/>
</p>
<p class="Note">
NOTE: Due to processing order, only the currently pending revision can be skipped,
not an arbitrary one.
</p>
<p>
Skipping a revision for a replay process cannot be undone. However, since skipping
is not persisted, the 
<a href="merge_wizard.html">Subcherry Merge Wizard</a>
can be used again to select skipped revisions for processing.
</p>

<h2>Reset</h2>
<p>
To re-process the currently pending revision, users can press the
<img src="../images/merge_view_reset.png"/> button and confirming their
decision in the newly opened dialog by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_reset_confirm.png"/>

</p>
<p class="Note">
NOTE: Due to processing order, only the currently pending revision can be reset,
not an arbitrary one.
</p>
<p>
Revisions are reset by setting their replay state back to <i>pending</i> thus
allowing for error correction or change re-application. This is especially useful
when replaying complex revisions with lots of conflicting resources requiring
manual merging which is known to be error-prone.
</p>

<h2>Conflicts</h2>
<p>
In the course of replaying the revision history various conflicts may ocur
when applying revision changes to the current workspace. In such cases the replay
process is paused and the currently pending revision displays a warning icon.
Conflict details can be inspected in the <b>Synchronize</b> view and resolved
using <a href="https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/wiki">subclipse</a>
tooling in-place.
</p>
<p>
If the <b>No Commit</b> setting was <b>not enabled</b> in the Subcherry Merge Wizard's
<a href="merge_wizard.html#no_commit">Additional settings</a> section, the changed
resources are grouped in a separate <b>change set</b>.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_changes.png"/>

The change set's name is applied using the following format:
<span class="Code">Revision [&lt;number&gt;]</span>. To adjust the rewritten
commit message users can open the change set's context menu by right-clicking it
and selecting the <b>Edit Change Set...</b> option.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_message.png"/>

In the above dialog, the <b>commit comment</b> is the actual message which will
be used to commit the change set. Changing the text and confirming it by pressing
the <b>OK</b> button will store the new commit message until the change set is
either reverted or committed.
</p>
<p class="Note">
NOTE: It is not recommended to commit the generated change sets manually since there is
currently no technically sophisticated way to detect that. Manually committed change
sets will result in the currently pending revision being switched to the 
<b>Merged, commit pending</b> replay state which might be quite confusing. In such
cases, the currently pending revision can be <b>Skip</b>ed since there are no
outgoing changes after the entire change set has been committed successfully.
</p>
<p>
Resolving all conflicts detected when applying the currently pending revision
to the workspace will cause the revision's replay state to be switched to
<b>Merged, commit pending</b> and the automatic replay process can be resumed
by pressing the <img src="../images/merge_view_run.png"/> button again.
</p>
<p class="Note">
NOTE: Trying to resume the automatic replay process with conflicts still remaining
will have no effect.
</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>
Errors occurred while accessing the SVN repository, local resources, applying 
revision changes or committing them etc. will cause the automatic replay
process to pause and the currently pending revision displaying an error icon.

<img class="Image" src="../images/merge_view_errors.png"/>

Opening the revision's details dialog will reveal the most recently encountered
error message in the <b>Error details</b> section.
</p>
<p class="Note">
NOTE: Due to the unexpected nature of this kind of errors, it's nearly impossible
to detect when the error has been resolved. Hence, the automatic replay process can
be resumed/retried while the currently pending revision is still in error state.
