<h1>Subcherry Merge Wizard</h1>
<p>
This chapter deals with the Subcherry Merge Wizard which guides users through the
process of picking the right revisions (cherries) to be replayed. However, before
opening the wizard, several requirements have to be met to ensure smooth revision
replay with minimal user interaction.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
In order to be able to pick revision for replay, the following conditions must be
met prior to opening the Subcherry Merge Wizard:

<ul>
<li>
Checkout all relevant modules <b>from the target branch</b> on which to replay the
revisions.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that <b>no outgoing</b> changes are present in the current workspace by either
reverting or committing them.
</li>
<li>
Make sure to <b>update</b> the relevant modules to the target branch's <b>HEAD</b> 
revision in order to avoid the <i>out of date</i> error messages.
</li>
<li>
It is highly recommended to switch to the <b>Synchronize Perspective</b> before opening
the Subcherry Merge Wizard in order to avoid switch between perspective during replay. 
</li>
<li>
Since revision replay is performed on revision level, the <b>Synchronize view</b> should display
change sets by enabling the option <b>Display Change Sets</b>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Source Selection</h2>
<p>
In order to open the Subcherry Merge Wizard just press the <img src="../images/wizard_open.png">
button in the eclipse toolbar.

<img class="Image" src="../images/wizard_source.png"/>

The newly opened dialog will prompt the user to select the source
branch to replay the revisions from.
</p>

<h3>Source branch</h3>
<p>
The branch, to replay the revision history from, can be either entered directly into the input 
field or selected using the <b>Select...</b> button. The branch name must match the branch pattern
configured in <a href="preferences.html#branch_pattern">preference settings</a>.
</p>

<h3>Start revision</h3>
<p>
This field prompts users for the starting revision from which (<i>inclusive</i>) to start reading
the commit history of the selected source branch. This is quite helpful for branches with a very
long revision history in cases when only a part of it is to be replayed.
</p>

<h3>Include merged revisions</h3>
<p>
When revisions are replayed, the process is logged using the <i>svn:mergeinfo</i>
property on the module level. When reading the commit history of the selected source branch,
already replayed revisions are excluded automatically. In order to prevent Subcherry from
excluding these revisions this checkbox can be activated.
</p>

<h2>Module Selection</h2>
<p>
The next step after choosing the source branch is to select the modules for which to replay
the commit history. This is done on the following page.

<img class="Image" src="../images/wizard_target.png"/>

On the left, all open eclipse projects, checked out into the current workspace from the same SVN
repository as the selected source branch, are listed. These projects represent modules in the 
branch structure. For workspaces with a large number of projects, the options list can be filtered
using regular expressions. 
Single modules can be selected either by double-clicking the project or by selecting
it and pressing the <b>Add</b> button. Pressing the <b>Add All</b> button selects all currently
<i>visible</i> modules in the options list.
</p>
<p class="Note">
<b>NOTE:</b> Currently, replaying commit history is supported only for a single branch.
Thus, selecting modules from different branches will result in an error message being displayed
next to the <b>Target branch</b> field.
</p>

<h2>Feature Selection</h2>
<p>
Once the source branch and target modules haven been selected, the commit history is computed
while grouping revisions by the feature referenced in the commit message.

<img class="Image" src="../images/wizard_tickets.png"/>

The above wizard page allows users to choose features to be replayed on the target branch
computed from selected modules. Initially, all features with all their respective revisions
are selected.
</p>
<p>
On the left, a tree view displays all features read from the commit history. The features'
label is read from trac and matches the following format:
<span class="Code">Ticket #&lt;id&gt;: &lt;summary&gt;</span>.
Revisions, referencing features in their commit messages, are displayed as child nodes using
the following label format: <span class="Code">Revision [&lt;number&gt;]: &lt;message&gt;</span>.
</p>
<h3 id="revision_details">Revision Details</h3>
<p>
On the right, detailed information is displayed for the revision selected in the tree on the right.
In addition to basic revision data such as <b>id</b>, <b>date</b>, <b>author</b> and
<b>message</b>, a compressed tree view of changed <b>Resources</b> allows users to quickly decide 
whether the selected revision is replay-relevant or not. 
</p>

<h3>Filtering and Selection</h3>
<p>
For source branches with a long commit history, the feature tree on the left might become quite
large. In such cases, a filter can be used to find and select relevant features and even revisions.
The filter works as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The filter text is first applied to the feature label. If the label matches, the feature is 
accepted along with all its child revisions unconditionally.
</li>
<li>
If the feature label does not match the filter text, the filter is applied to the revision's
label. Only matching revisions result in them being visible under their owning feature node.
</li>
<li>
If neither the feature nor any of its revisions match the filter text, the entire feature is
invisible.
</li>
</ol>
In order to select (unselect) the entire feature just check (uncheck) the checkbox next to it.
This way, all its revisions are marked as selected (unselected) as well. To select (unselect) all
currently visible features including their revisions the <b>Select All</b> (<b>Unselect All</b>)
button can be used.
</p>

<h2>Mode Selection</h2>
<p>
This page displays the selected <b>Source branch</b> and <b>Target branch</b> along
with the <b>Selected tickets and revisions</b>. So, now that Subcherry knows what to replay and where,
it's time to decide on the hows.

</p>

<h3>Rewrite commit messages</h3>
<p>
In the <b>Rewrite commit messages</b> settings group, users can choose how Subcherry will handle
commit messages of replayed revisions.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Port</b>: Commit messages will be rewritten unconditionally using the following pattern:
<span class="Code">Ported to &lt;target branch&gt; from &lt;source branch&gt;: &lt;message&gt;.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Rebase</b>: Only the branch referenced in the commit message will be rewritten
to <span class="Code">&lt;target branch&gt;</span>, the commit type and message are preserved.
</li>
<li>
<b>Preview</b>: Commit messages will be rewritten unconditionally using the following pattern:
<span class="Code">Preview on &lt;target branch&gt;: &lt;message&gt;.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Reintegrate</b>: Commit messages will be rewritten unconditionally using the following pattern:
<span class="Code">On &lt;target branch&gt;: &lt;message&gt;.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="no_commit">No commit</h3>
<p>
Enabling this setting will result in selected revisions being applied to the current workspace
without being committed to the SVN repository. This way, a preview mode can be emulated in order
to found out whether unresolvable conflicts may cause problems during replay.
</p>

<h2>Finish</h2>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Finish</b> button with close the dialog and open the
<a href="merge_view.html">Subcherry Merge View</a>.
