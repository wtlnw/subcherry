<h1>Subcherry Preferences</h1>
<p>
Before running Subcherry for the first time, its global settings should be reviewed
and adjusted to match the current environment. In this chapter, each global setting
is explained in detail. To edit the global settings for Subcherry, please open the
eclipse <b>Preferences</b> dialog and select <i>Subcherry</i>.

</p>

<h2>Enable semantic moves</h2>
<p>
When replaying revisions from one branch on another, <span class="Code">svn copy</span>
operations are semantically analyzed in order to distinguish between <i>inter-branch</i> and 
<i>intra-branch</i> copies.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inter-branch</i> copies are detected when the source copy path is 
outside the receiving branch. Usually, such copies are created when creating branches 
(e.g. <span class="Code">svn copy /trunk /branches/feature_1234</span>).
</p>

<p>
<i>Intra-branch</i> (or branch-local) copies however occur when resources are copied from one
subtree of a branch to another subtree within the same branch. The typical use case for
intra-branch copies is the <span class="Code">svn move</span> operation for moving or 
renaming resources.
</p>
<p>
Enabling this setting will force Subcherry to detect branch-local copy operations and 
replay these in a semantically correct way. In other words, when replaying the copy 
operation
</p>
<p class="Code">svn copy /branches/feature_1234/foo.txt /branches/feature_1234/bar.txt
</p>
<p>
on <span class="Code">/trunk</span> Subcherry will actually execute the semantically equivalent
</p> 
<p class="Code">svn copy /trunk/foo.txt /trunk/bar.txt
</p>
<p>
when this setting is enabled thus preserving branch-local history of <span class="Code">
foo.txt</span> for <span class="Code">bar.txt</span>. Disabling this setting would result in
</p> 
<p class="Code">svn copy /branches/feature_1234/foo.txt /trunk/bar.txt
</p>
<p>
being executed which will lead to <span class="Code">bar.txt</span> originating from
another branch and thus losing its branch-local history.
</p>

<h2>Trunk pattern</h2>
<p>
A regular expression describing the pattern to be used for resolving the repository trunk
layout which is crucial for identifying branch-local copy operations.
The default value is
<span class="Code">/trunk/[^/\._]+/|/trunk/</span>
which assumes the default SVN repository layout of the following form:
</p>
<p class="Code">repository
   trunk
      &lt;category&gt;
         &lt;module&gt;
</p>

<h2 id="branch_pattern">Branch pattern</h2>
<p>
A regular expression describing the pattern to be used for resolving the repository layout
for branches. As with <b>Trunk pattern</b>, it is crucial for identifying branch-local 
copy operations. The default value is 
<span class="Code">/branches/[^/]+/[^/]+/|/tags/[^/]+/[^/]+/</span>
which assumes the default SVN repository layout of the following form:
</p>
<p class="Code">repository
   branches
      &lt;category&gt;
         &lt;branch&gt;
            &lt;module&gt;
   tags
      &lt;category&gt;
         &lt;tag&gt;
            &lt;module&gt;
</p>

<h2>Trac URL</h2>
<p>
In order for Subcherry to be able to resolve feature issues from 
<a href="https://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> the XML RPC access URL has to be
configured. The default value 
<span class="Code">http://&lt;myserver&gt;/trac/login/xmlrpc</span>
is one of the most commonly used URL patterns and requires users to replace the
<span class="Code">&lt;myserver&gt;</span> part with the appropriate host name
or IP address of the trac server instance.
</p>

<h2 id="credentials">Credentials...</h2>
<p>
Along with the <b>Trac URL</b>, the access credentials are required in order to be
able to access the specified trac instance. These credentials can be provided by
pressing the <b>Credentials...</b> button.
